LLS_EIGHT_POINT_ALG  computes the fundamental matrix from matching points using 
linear least squares eight point algorithm
Arguments:
    points1 - N points in the first image that match with points2

    Both points1 and points2 are from the get_data_from_txt_file() method
Returns:
    F - the fundamental matrix such that (points2)^T * F * points1 = 0
Please see lecture notes and slides to see how the linear least squares eight
point algorithm works
